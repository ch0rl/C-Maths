    The following are instructions for adding to this program.

    \section{Adding an Operator (length 1)}
        To add an operator that is represented by one character, you must do the following:
        
        \subsection*{Functions.h}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Implement the necessary functions for the backend of the operator; these functions must have the following signature\footnote{\mlc{arg_n} will be known for most functions but is there to allow for functions with multiple, different, numbers of arguments.}\footnote{Examples of how these functions should work can be seen in Functions.h.}:
                    \begin{minted}{c}
T_Tree_Node function(T_Tree_Node *args, unsigned int arg_n)                     
                    \end{minted}
                \item Add to the switch-case in the appropriate function: \\
                    \begin{table}[H]
                        \begin{tabular}{c | c}
                            Numeric & \mlc{get_numeric_func} \\
                            Symbolic & Not yet implemented 
                        \end{tabular}
                        \label{Function containing translations from operator representation to function.}
                    \end{table}
            \end{itemize}
        
        \subsection*{Tokenise.h}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Add to the \mlc{OPERATORS} array.
                \item Increment \mlc{OP_NUM}.
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection*{ToTree.h}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Add to the \mlc{N_ARG_LOOKUP} array accordingly (\mlc{{<op/func>, <op/func length>, <number of arguments>}}).
                \item Increment \mlc{N_ARG_LOOKUP_LEN}.
                \item Add to the switch-case in the \mlc{precedence} function.
            \end{itemize}
